# Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI's Gymnasium

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains all my work and notes for the course **Reinforcement Learning with Gymnasium in Python** and the project **Taxi Route Optimization with Reinforcement Learning** from DataCamp.

## Course Overview

In this course, I explored the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, utilizing the Gymnasium library in Python. The course covers various concepts, including:

- Understanding the basics of reinforcement learning
- Implementing algorithms using Gymnasium
- Practical exercises and projects to solidify learning

Whereas, the project is about solving the Taxi-v3 environment using Q-learning, ensuring efficient AI-driven transportation using exploration and exploitation.
